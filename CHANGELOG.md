### :zap: Improvements
- Support for v-model in switch.
- `render-prop` and `render-prop-fn` as API to provide a way to pass JSX as props (inline jsx props) or callback which      returns JSX thus avoiding the need to use JSX for components such as Flat List.
- Named Slots support and Basic scoped slots support.
